# Architecture and capability matrix

## Connected local runtime

React/TypeScript + Leaflet -> FastAPI -> immutable run folder + SQLite -> SAR/AIS/drift processing -> evidence/report -> API-backed dashboard.

`POST /api/v1/cases/demo` creates a reproducible case. `POST /api/v1/cases/import` validates uploaded inputs. `POST /api/v1/cases/{id}/run` queues a thread worker and returns a run ID. `GET /api/v1/runs/{run_id}` reports actual stage/state. Completed per-section endpoints expose spill, origin, vessels, attribution, forecast, evidence, timeline, dark, quality, impact and provenance.

Original files are copied into the run before analysis. The analysis identity hashes input checksums, parameters, backend code hashes and model version. PDF and evidence ZIP are generated before a run becomes COMPLETE. A failed run does not replace the last successful analysis. Server restart marks interrupted jobs failed so they can be explicitly rerun.

## Method details

Drift velocity is current + windage × wind. Uncertain velocity perturbations remain correlated through a particle's trajectory. Independent diffusion is added each quarter-hour. Release time is sampled within the supplied window. Forward horizons are 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours. There is no claim that time reversal perfectly reconstructs weathered oil.

Attribution weights sum to one: origin proximity 0.35, temporal coverage 0.10, mean trajectory overlap 0.25, speed reduction 0.12, course change 0.08, and release-window AIS gap 0.10. Proximity decays with the modeled uncertainty radius. These are explicit heuristic weights, not fitted likelihoods. Nationality/name do not influence the score.

SAR vessel screening identifies small bright connected components. A spatial match requires less than 2 km separation and at most 15 minutes between AIS and acquisition. This baseline cannot distinguish every structure, speckle return, ship and wake; unmatched returns remain unconfirmed.

## Production integration points

Replace the SAR screening entry point in `backend/satellite.py` with a validated segmentation/look-alike model that returns the same geometry/metadata contract. Replace the uniform forcing adapter in `backend/drift.py` with a gridded space/time interpolator and physics modules. Keep raw artifacts and algorithm versions in every result. Move the storage interface to PostGIS and add durable workers, authentication, signed evidence storage and independent benchmark validation before network/operational deployment.
